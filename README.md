### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Ahmet, I was born in Ä°stanbul in 2003. I have been working as a intern front-end developer for 1 years and I used, a lot of modern technologies during this time, such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind Css, SCSS and LESS. Nowadays, I'm trying to improve my Javascript skills and learning about Loops, Arrays, Objects etc. And also Iâ€™m interested in React. Besides, Iâ€™m a quick learner and researcher, I know that I can find any information with google.
